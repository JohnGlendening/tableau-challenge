Thoughts:

1) Oakland Ave was the highest starting point by far. It's located in a relatively dense area, but there's no other easily noticeable correlation as to why this would be the number 1 starting point.
2) The older population seems to go on longer bike rides than today's youth. 
3) The majority of CitiBike users are customers rather than subscribers, thus far this year.
4) I noticed less bike rides are taken by the water. I'd think more riders would enjoy the cool, moist air. However, this is not the case.
